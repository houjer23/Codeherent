# Codeherent

The website code for the platform Codeherent. Here is the mission statement.

This platform is a place for students to get started in computer science. Usually, students are afraid to approach computer science because they always hear about how hard it is. Thus, some students might be very talented in computer science but will not take computer science classes. Nevertheless, the platform will show students how simple it is to create a program and how fascinating is computer science, allowing more students to have the desire to explore computer science by themselves.
